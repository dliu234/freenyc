  "Title: THE NO OFFICE HOLIDAY PARTY RETURNS WEDNESDAY (SPONSORED)\n\nContent:\nTHE NO OFFICE HOLIDAY PARTY RETURNS WEDNESDAY (SPONSORED)\nHo ho ho, another year has passed, and that means it’s time for another No Office Holiday party! Presented by\nThe New York Groove\n, a local, independent, journalist-owned, member-supported newsletter, this annual tradition melds all the fun and light chaos of an actual office party, without any of our actual bosses there. What could possibly be better?\nIf you answered “the redistribution of gifts and the dismantling of the Christmas industrial complex,” you’re in luck because this year’s theme is Red Christmas, and we’re here to tell you, Santifa Claus is headed our way, has been radicalized, and is not messing around. This party will also have:\n• Flash tattoos from St. Kenia!\n• Cover tunes from Imitation Crab!\n• Drink specials!\n• Raffle prizes, including the much-coveted ✨golden ticket✨ from Open House New York, which you can’t get anywhere else!\n• A DJ! Dancing!\n• Other stuff that’s a surprise and you’ll have to show up to find out!\nThe New York Groove Presents: The No Office Holiday Party\nWednesday, December 17 7:30pm doors\nlittlefield\n635 Sackett Street, Brooklyn 11217\nGET TICKETS\nAs always, New York Groove members at the True Believer level and above get in for\nfree\n. If you aren’t a member yet,\nsign up today\nand you’ll be sent a free code.\nsponsored post\n\nEvent-Link Mappings:\nNo specific event-link mappings found\n\nAll >> Links:\nNo >> links found\n\nDefault Link: https://theskint.com/the-no-office-holiday-party-returns-wednesday-sponsored/\n"
