We’re teaming up with Imbibe and Campari for a week-long celebration of the iconic Italian cocktail. Ten local bars and restaurants will showcase exclusive menus—from the timeless original to inventive riffs that spotlight the creative flair of Myrtle Avenue’s mixologists.\nWhat’s on the menu:\n•\nDoppelgänger –\nThe Negroni\n: Plymouth Gin, Punt E Mes & Cappelletti.\n•\nThe Emerson –\nNordic Negroni\n: Michigan-made Aquavit adds caraway, dill, sage, and dried orange for a spiced, Nordic twist.\n•\nLaRina Pastificio e Vino –\nCuore Matto Negroni\n: Strawberries and basil meet gin in a fresh, flirty ode to la dolce vita.\n•\nLula Mae –\nMekong Gold Negroni\n: Cambodian-distilled gin stars alongside classic and white variations.\n•\nMr. Lee’s –\nBittersweet Negroni\n: Mezcal, Cynar, and Lucano Amaro layered with orange bitters for herbal depth.\n•\nOsteria Brooklyn –\nSmoked Negroni\n: Gray Whale Gin, crafted with California botanicals, brings a coastal smokiness.\n•\nPutnam’s Pub –\nGlendalough Rose Negroni\n: Floral Irish rose gin, Select aperitif, and Dolin Rouge vermouth create an elegant European blend. (Putnam’s owner Gerry Rooney’s brother Rowdy, who is the head distiller at Glendalough, uses rose petals from their late mother’s garden to produce Glendalough’s Rose Gin.)\n•\nRosticceria Evelina – Five Negroni Variations!\nIncluding a Banana Kingston (clarified banana rum), Earl Grey (damask rose & juniper gin), Oaxaca (made with mezcal & gin, coffee-infused Campari & Carpano Antica), Smoked Artichoke Negroni (mezcal, cynar & sweet vermouth) & a Sbagliato (Stellare Primo, Antica Torino & topped with Prosecco).\n•\nThird Falcon\n– A unique house twist on the classic.\n•\nVine –\nStone Garden Negroni\n: With Fords gin at its base, The Stone Garden balances the classic bitter backbone of Campari with the rich depth of Antica Carpano and a dark plum sweetness from Choya Kokuto, creating a refined and earthy twist on tradition.\nWhether you’re a Negroni devotee or a first-time sipper, this is your chance to enjoy limited-edition cocktails while supporting local businesses.

ONE ID PER TICKET, FOR OTHER ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS – SEE BELOW.\nSINGLE TICKETS AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE FOR $65** WITH CODE SKINT65!\nGET TICKETS AT\nTFANA.ORG\nIbsen’s 1884 play\nThe Wild Duck\nis an accessible, provocative, modern drama centered in a family.\nGregers Werle, the idealistic and dogmatic son of a wealthy businessman, wreaks havoc when he embarks on a crusade to unveil the false foundations of the life of his friend, Hjalmar Ekdal. Ignorant of the adults’ machinations, Hedvig, a young girl, tries to shield the fragile eponymous duck from the injuries of the world. Gregers’ imposition of “righteousness” however, leads to turmoil and death. Ibsen’s genius was to create complex characters who compel us with their humanity.\nDirector Simon Godwin observes, “Ibsen was consciously trying to redirect us from the easy classification of ‘\nthis is a comedy, this is a tragedy\n.’ And he was following the steps of the late plays of Shakespeare in recognizing that we can move dexterously from something that makes us smile to something that makes us cry. The tragedy and the comedy are a ‘mingled yarn’ (to quote Shakespeare) of emotional possibility. We are drawn into a very compelling story and left to consider the role of truth in our own lives.”\nSimon Godwin (Chekhov’s\nUncle Vanya\nstarring Hugh Bonneville and Shakespeare’s\nMacbeth\nwith Indira Varma and Ralph Fiennes), Artistic Director of Shakespeare Theatre Company, returns to TFANA (\nMeasure for Measure\nand\nTimon of Athens\n) to direct this rarely produced Ibsen masterpiece.\nDavid Eldridge’s version had its world premiere at London’s Donmar Warehouse in 2005. Michael Billington wrote “Eldridge brings out Ibsen’s permanent relevance without any textual coarsening…\nThe Wild Duck\nexplains why Ibsen is the greatest dramatist after Shakespeare” (\nThe Guardian\n). This is the first major Off-Broadway production of the play in the Eldridge version.\nCast:\nKatie Broad\n(Pettersen),\nMelanie Field\n(Gina Ekdal),\nAlexander Hurt\n(Gregers Werle),\nMahira Kakkar\n(Mrs Sørby),\nDavid Patrick Kelly\n(Old Ekdal),\nMaaike Laanstra-Corn\n(Hedvig),\nTracie Lane\n(Pettersen understudy),\nBobby Plasencia\n(Mr Flor),\nMatthew Saldívar\n(Relling/Captain Balle),\nAlexander Sovronsky\n(Jensen),\nRobert Stanton\n(Håkon Werle),\nNick Westrate\n(Hjalmar Ekdal).\nWATCH\nTHE WILD DUCK\nTRAILER\nPolonsky Shakespeare Center: 262 Ashland Place, Brooklyn, NY 11217\n* Each New Deal ticket holder must be 30 years of age and under, or a full-time student.

Ignorant of the adults’ machinations, Hedvig, a young girl, tries to shield the fragile eponymous duck from the injuries of the world. Gregers’ imposition of “righteousness” however, leads to turmoil and death. Ibsen’s genius was to create complex characters who compel us with their humanity.\nDirector Simon Godwin observes, “Ibsen was consciously trying to redirect us from the easy classification of ‘\nthis is a comedy, this is a tragedy\n.’ And he was following the steps of the late plays of Shakespeare in recognizing that we can move dexterously from something that makes us smile to something that makes us cry. The tragedy and the comedy are a ‘mingled yarn’ (to quote Shakespeare) of emotional possibility. We are drawn into a very compelling story and left to consider the role of truth in our own lives.”\nSimon Godwin (Chekhov’s\nUncle Vanya\nstarring Hugh Bonneville and Shakespeare’s\nMacbeth\nwith Indira Varma and Ralph Fiennes), Artistic Director of Shakespeare Theatre Company, returns to TFANA (\nMeasure for Measure\nand\nTimon of Athens\n) to direct this rarely produced Ibsen masterpiece.\nDavid Eldridge’s version had its world premiere at London’s Donmar Warehouse in 2005. Michael Billington wrote “Eldridge brings out Ibsen’s permanent relevance without any textual coarsening…\nThe Wild Duck\nexplains why Ibsen is the greatest dramatist after Shakespeare” (\nThe Guardian\n). This is the first major Off-Broadway production of the play in the Eldridge version.\nDIRECTOR SIMON GODWIN DISCUSSES THE WILD DUCK\nPolonsky Shakespeare Center: 262 Ashland Place, Brooklyn, NY 11217\n* Each New Deal ticket holder must be 30 years of age and under, or a full-time student.
