This month’s lineup includes:\nSienna Liu, Emily J. Smith, Brian Gresko, Sarah Kasbeer, and g.m. palmer\n.\nAlso enjoy the exhibit by local artist, Lisett Clark-Dziedzic,\nOpenness\n, which brings together a deeply personal and political narrative through works made from recycled materials, fabric collages, and photography.
