Little-known details about Kafka, the man with the matchless imagination, are revealed in this bracing, off-kilter, always-surprising show.\nUse code SKINT to snag $19 tickets* (reg. $44)!\nValid for all performances\nPerformances: June 12 – 29, Tues-Fri 7:15; Sat 2:15 & 7:15; Sun 2:15.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE INFO\n59E59 Theaters – a quick block from SUBWAY 4/5/6 N/W/R at 59 St.\n*Standard service fees apply to all phone/internet orders.
