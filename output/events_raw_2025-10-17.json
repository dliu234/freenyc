Ignorant of the adults’ machinations, Hedvig, a young girl, tries to shield the fragile eponymous duck from the injuries of the world. Gregers’ imposition of “righteousness” however, leads to turmoil and death. Ibsen’s genius was to create complex characters who compel us with their humanity.\nDirector Simon Godwin observes, “Ibsen was consciously trying to redirect us from the easy classification of ‘\nthis is a comedy, this is a tragedy\n.’ And he was following the steps of the late plays of Shakespeare in recognizing that we can move dexterously from something that makes us smile to something that makes us cry. The tragedy and the comedy are a ‘mingled yarn’ (to quote Shakespeare) of emotional possibility. We are drawn into a very compelling story and left to consider the role of truth in our own lives.”\nSimon Godwin (Chekhov’s\nUncle Vanya\nstarring Hugh Bonneville and Shakespeare’s\nMacbeth\nwith Indira Varma and Ralph Fiennes), Artistic Director of Shakespeare Theatre Company, returns to TFANA (\nMeasure for Measure\nand\nTimon of Athens\n) to direct this rarely produced Ibsen masterpiece.\nDavid Eldridge’s version had its world premiere at London’s Donmar Warehouse in 2005. Michael Billington wrote “Eldridge brings out Ibsen’s permanent relevance without any textual coarsening…\nThe Wild Duck\nexplains why Ibsen is the greatest dramatist after Shakespeare” (\nThe Guardian\n). This is the first major Off-Broadway production of the play in the Eldridge version.\nCast:\nKatie Broad\n(Pettersen),\nMelanie Field\n(Gina Ekdal),\nAlexander Hurt\n(Gregers Werle),\nMahira Kakkar\n(Mrs Sørby),\nDavid Patrick Kelly\n(Old Ekdal),\nMaaike Laanstra-Corn\n(Hedvig),\nTracie Lane\n(Pettersen understudy),\nBobby Plasencia\n(Mr Flor),\nMatthew Saldívar\n(Relling/Captain Balle),\nAlexander Sovronsky\n(Jensen),\nRobert Stanton\n(Håkon Werle),\nNick Westrate\n(Hjalmar Ekdal).\nWATCH\nTHE WILD DUCK\nTRAILER\nPolonsky Shakespeare Center: 262 Ashland Place, Brooklyn, NY 11217\n* Each New Deal ticket holder must be 30 years of age and under, or a full-time student.
