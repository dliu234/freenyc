Inspired by the work of queer artist David Wojnarowicz.\nDirector\nMalena Dayen\ninterprets Valerie Solanas’ underground classic\nUP YOUR ASS\nas a new opera. This long-suppressed work is an unapologetically bold and sharply satirical work from one of radical feminism’s most provocative voices.\nTMT Associate Artist\nAnthony Vaughn Merchant\nleads\nNEXT UP\n, a piece inspired by and featuring new voices lead by the counterculture of punk, exploring the question, “what does punk mean to me?” See you in the pit.\nOne-night artistic events enrich the program even more. On\nMonday, September 29\n, join us for a TMT Community Cafe for Degenerates, an evening for all those along the margins to gather in the Doxsee over light bites and a collective reading of\nThe Bus Stop\nby\nGao Xingjian\n.

Buy your $20 New Deal ticket for the 7:30PM performance of\nThe Wild Duck\nand stay for a free post-show talkback with writer David Eldridge and moderator Paul Walsh. This talkback will be immediately followed by a party at Fulton Hall with complimentary food and drinks and wonderful opportunities to connect with other artists and theatregoers.\nSINGLE TICKETS AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE FOR $65** WITH CODE SKINT65!\nGET TICKETS AT\nTFANA.ORG\nIbsen’s 1884 play\nThe Wild Duck\nis an accessible, provocative, modern drama centered in a family.\nGregers Werle, the idealistic and dogmatic son of a wealthy businessman, wreaks havoc when he embarks on a crusade to unveil the false foundations of the life of his friend, Hjalmar Ekdal. Ignorant of the adults’ machinations, Hedvig, a young girl, tries to shield the fragile eponymous duck from the injuries of the world. Gregers’ imposition of “righteousness” however, leads to turmoil and death. Ibsen’s genius was to create complex characters who compel us with their humanity.\nDirector Simon Godwin observes, “Ibsen was consciously trying to redirect us from the easy classification of ‘\nthis is a comedy, this is a tragedy\n.’ And he was following the steps of the late plays of Shakespeare in recognizing that we can move dexterously from something that makes us smile to something that makes us cry. The tragedy and the comedy are a ‘mingled yarn’ (to quote Shakespeare) of emotional possibility. We are drawn into a very compelling story and left to consider the role of truth in our own lives.”\nSimon Godwin (Chekhov’s\nUncle Vanya\nstarring Hugh Bonneville and Shakespeare’s\nMacbeth\nwith Indira Varma and Ralph Fiennes), Artistic Director of Shakespeare Theatre Company, returns to TFANA (\nMeasure for Measure\nand\nTimon of Athens\n) to direct this rarely produced Ibsen masterpiece.\nDavid Eldridge’s version had its world premiere at London’s Donmar Warehouse in 2005. Michael Billington wrote “Eldridge brings out Ibsen’s permanent relevance without any textual coarsening…\nThe Wild Duck\nexplains why Ibsen is the greatest dramatist after Shakespeare” (\nThe Guardian\n). This is the first major Off-Broadway production of the play in the Eldridge version.\nDIRECTOR SIMON GODWIN DISCUSSES THE WILD DUCK\nPolonsky Shakespeare Center: 262 Ashland Place, Brooklyn, NY 11217\n* Each New Deal ticket holder must be 30 years of age and under, or a full-time student.
