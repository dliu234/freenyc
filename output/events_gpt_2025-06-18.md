### 🎉 Kafka

📍 Location: 59E59 Theaters  
🕒 Time: June 12 – 29 Tues-Fri 7:15; Sat 2:15 & 7:15; Sun 2:15  
📝 Franz Kafka is still the presiding genius of experimental storytelling. A hundred years on from his death at the age of just 40, Kafka remains the voice of the outsider and the disempowered – struggling between the agony of solitude and the pains of intimacy, isolated in the big city and in the world, whilst never forgetting how absurd and hilarious life can be. Multi-award-winning writer and performer Jack Klaff (Star Wars) nimbly portrays Kafka’s friends, lovers, and critics – including Alan Bennett, Bertolt Brecht, Albert Camus, Samuel Beckett, Albert Einstein, among many others – to paint a mosaic of his life. Little-known details about Kafka, the man with the matchless imagination, are revealed in this bracing, off-kilter, always-surprising show.
