(SPONSORED)\n‘Tis the Season – From cozy classics to bold new interpretations, Brooklyn’s Myrtle Avenue is stirring up holiday magic during its first-ever\nSip the Season Holiday Cocktail Competition\non Myrtle Avenue thru Dec. 14.\nFor a limited time only, sample specially crafted cocktails, each infused with festive flair and holiday flavor, then cast your vote to help select the top three cocktails for consideration by a panel of local judges who will determine Myrtle Avenue’s favorite holiday cocktail!\nParticipating Locations & Holidays Cocktails\n:\n•\nThird Falcon\n, 360 Myrtle Ave, Fort Greene\nHoliday Hot Toddy\n–  Channeling cozy Northern French & Fort Greene charm with a warming mix of Calvados and brandy steeped in rooibos tea and rounded out with soothing notes of apple and honey.\n•\nLaRina Pastificio e Vino\n, 387 Myrtle Ave, Fort Greene\nMare di Miele\n– A playful riff on an Afterhours son, it’s an easy-drinking mix of rum, honey, and apple cider that tastes like heading to a December rugby game in the Venetian province: crisp air, chilled sweetness, and that familiar bite of winter waking you up.\n•\nDoppelgänger\n, 415 Myrtle Ave, Clinton Hill\nNon Denominational\n– A cozy combination of a Boulevardier and an Old Fashioned to warm your hearth. A housemade spiced cranberry syrup adds a seasonal touch to some old holiday favorites.\n•\nRosticceria Evelina\n, 455 Myrtle Ave, Clinton Hill\nNegroni al Panettone\n– Panettone is an Italian staple for the Christmas season. Traditionally, it is a sweet bread flavored with dried fruit, like raisins and citrus peels. In this seasonal Negroni we capitalize on the multitude of different flavorings of a panettone and express it in a multitude of different ways and techniques.\n•\nLula Mae\n, 472 Myrtle Ave, Clinton Hill\nOh Lula Tree\n– Blending Espolòn tequila, Fernet Menta, pandan syrup, and espresso into a bold, aromatic holiday sip crowned with a festive mint-foam Christmas tree\n•\nThe Emerson\n, 561 Myrtle Ave, Clinton Hill\nThe Whited Air\n– Part of a descriptive line in Ralph Waldo Emerson’s, poem, “The Snow-Storm.”\nThat’s not all…Sip the Season is more than delicious drinks — it’s a chance to support the neighborhoods of Fort Greene & Clinton Hill. Consider making a donation to the Myrtle Avenue Brooklyn Partnership in support of local programming and community partnerships, with a percentage of all holiday donations benefiting One Community in their work to combat food insecurity.\nView the cocktails and details\nhere\n.\nsponsored post\n\nEvent-Link Mappings:\nNo specific event-link mappings found\n\nAll >> Links:\nNo >> links found\n\nDefault Link: https://theskint.com/sip-savor-select-myrtle-avenues-favorite-holiday-cocktail-sponsored/\n",
