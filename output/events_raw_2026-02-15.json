  "Title: TARGET MARGIN THEATER PRESENTS THIS IS REAL STARTING MARCH 1 (SPONSORED)\n\nContent:\nTARGET MARGIN THEATER PRESENTS THIS IS REAL STARTING MARCH 1 (SPONSORED)\nThis is Real\nbrings the transgressive spirit of\nJean Genet\nto life for America in 2026. Created by 2025 Obie Award-winning director\nDavid Herskovits\nand a cohort of artists, this new work features Genet’s obsessions: power, sex, and revolution. Genet was a thief, drifter, prostitute, who wrote from prison; his work affronted convention and challenged audiences to question their own lives. His artistic descendants include Ludlam, Jack Smith, David Bowie, and us at Target Margin Theater! We admire Genet’s unflinching honesty in confronting power without fear. He does not judge. He is never prim or pious. Our work swells with that bravery.\nThis Is Real\nrepresents a vision of America as we have re-created it here and now. This is a patriotic play.\nThe source material for\nThis Is Real\nhas been pillaged from various Genet writings including his early memoirs about prison and criminal life; his first novel\nOur Lady of the Flowers\n; and all his plays from\nDeathwatch\nto\nThe Balcony\nto\nThe Screens\n. Genet’s final work,\nPrisoner of Love\n, has become a special inspiration. These vivid stories from years among Palestinian refugees and freedom fighters in the 1970s call out across the years with special immediacy now.\nAbove all, Genet was committed to representing the outsiders of our world, the\ncounterculture, misfits, losers\n, and\ncriminals\n.\nThis is Real\nasks our audience to consider these degenerates anew. What is the beauty and wisdom of the outsider? Aren’t we, all of us, outsiders in our own ways?\nThis is Real\nruns March 1 through April 4 at the Doxsee Theater in Sunset Park, Brooklyn.\nTickets starting from $30:\nTargetMargin.org/ThisIsReal\nsponsored post\n\nEvent-Link Mappings:\nNo specific event-link mappings found\n\nAll >> Links:\nNo >> links found\n\nDefault Link: https://theskint.com/target-margin-theater-presents-this-is-real-starting-march-1-sponsored/\n",
